With North Korea responding that it would, if attacked, strike American military forces in Guam, analysts warned that the escalating statements increased the likelihood of war — perhaps one based on miscalculation, should one side’s fiery rhetoric be misread by the other.  Some played down Mr. Trump’s remark on Tuesday as simply a warning not to attack the United States, albeit one whose tone was more typical of North Korean propagandists than it was of past American presidents. Officials in South Korea and Japan said that while the situation was tense, it had not reached a crisis point.  Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson played down any imminent threat from North Korea, saying on Wednesday, “I think Americans should sleep well at night, have no concerns about this particular rhetoric of the last few days.”  Still, some in the region said that the danger of war had not seemed as clear and present in decades. What was unthinkable just years ago no longer seems so, they said.  “We’re going to see a confrontation between the United States and North Korea that will be ferocious and strong and bloody,” said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of international relations at Renmin University of China in Beijing. He called Mr. Trump’s language “explosive,” and said the threat and counterthreat had resulted in a new stage of confrontation.  Mr. Cheng said that he was also puzzled by the timing of Mr. Trump’s remark, just days after the United Nations Security Council imposed the toughest economic penalties yet on North Korea for its nuclear and missile programs. That unanimous vote, which overcame China’s historical reluctance to harshly punish its ally, has been widely described as the Trump administration’s greatest diplomatic accomplishment so far.  “Usually, the U. S. government is willing to give more time for a resolution, to see how the resolutions bite,” Mr. Cheng said.  Across the region on Wednesday, analysts reacted with concern and even foreboding about the tone of Mr. Trump’s comments, as well as about the unimpeded progress that North Korea appears to be making toward becoming a full-fledged nuclear power, able to strike the United States or other far-off adversaries.  While Mr. Trump’s warning that North Korea, if it kept threatening the United States, would “be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen” clearly reflected growing American frustration over the North’s advances, analysts said it was not clear that he had fully considered the implications of such strong language.  That, they said, raised questions about the administration’s strategy, and about whether Mr. Trump recognized the price that some of America’s staunchest allies, especially Japan and South Korea, could pay for carrying out his threat.  “Trump doesn’t seem to understand what an alliance is, and doesn’t seem to consider his ally when he says those things,” said Lee Byong-chul, a senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul, the South Korean capital. “No American president has mentioned a military option so easily, so offhandedly as he has. He unnerves people in South Korea, few of whom want war in Korea.”  Mr. Trump’s warning followed a report that American intelligence agencies believe that North Korea has made a nuclear weapon that can fit on the tip of a ballistic missile. Such drastic advances have already led Japan and South Korea to consider deploying new, more powerful weapons to counter the threat, after decades of relying on American military might for strategic security.  Itsunori Onodera, Japan’s new defense minister, said on Wednesday that Japan found it credible that North Korea had succeeded in miniaturizing a nuclear warhead, or that it would do so in the near future.  “At the very least, whether they have them now or will have them soon, it’s reached a level where we have to monitor vigilantly,” he said.  Officials in Asia and beyond have grown used to provocative musings by Mr. Trump, particularly on Twitter, and they tend to ignore them or to treat them as inaccurate reflections of American policy. But analysts saw his “fire and fury” remark as dangerous and unlikely to deter North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.  “We are used to painting North Korea as ‘unpredictable,’ but increasingly it is the U. S. that is introducing strategic unpredictability into a volatile dynamic,” Euan Graham, an analyst at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, wrote in an email.  He added that Mr. Trump’s warning would not have its desired effect because “the North Koreans have an ear for bluster.”  Mr. Cheng of Renmin University said that North Korea’s defiance in response to the Security Council’s latest sanctions indicated that it had no intention of slowing its program. He said that nations across the region, including his own, needed to start preparing for the consequences of a conflict.  “We are in a very dangerous time, and China is going to need to take notice and prepare for the worst,” he said.  China’s Foreign Ministry, responding to an inquiry Wednesday about Mr. Trump’s threat, restated its position that the North Korean nuclear issue should be resolved by political means and that “all relevant parties” should avoid “remarks and acts that may escalate the conflict.”  The South Korean government sought on Wednesday to ease concern about the situation, saying that the North’s recent posturing, including its threat to attack Guam, appeared to be aimed at tightening solidarity among its own population and causing its neighbors anxiety.  “The situation has become more serious on the Korean Peninsula,” a senior official at the presidential Blue House told South Korean reporters, speaking in a briefing on the condition of anonymity. “But we don’t think it has reached a crisis stage yet.”  Also on Wednesday, Pyongyang released a Canadian pastor, the Rev. Lim Hyeon-Soo, who had been sentenced to a life of hard labor, perhaps in an effort to avoid the potential embarrassment of releasing a prisoner in ill health nearly two months after the death of another prisoner, Otto F. Warmbier, an American college student.  “North Korea appears to signal that it could be flexible amid this standoff with the international community,” said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. He added that the freed pastor is Canadian, “so the North may find it easier to release him” than to be perceived as capitulating to a bellicose American president.  In Japan, a senior government official sought to frame Mr. Trump’s remark as an effort to warn Mr. Kim’s government that military action remained a possibility, even as the new sanctions begin going into effect.  “He’s saying that the United States is putting all options on the table,” said the official, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga. “Our government approves of that stance. It’s extremely important that the Japan-U. S. alliance further strengthens its ability to deter and respond.”  Even so, Mr. Trump’s language resonated deeply in Japan, which commemorated on Wednesday the 72nd anniversary of an American atomic bomb being dropped on Nagasaki at the end of World War II, three days after using one on Hiroshima.  “The world has seen American fire and fury in Hiroshima and Nagasaki 72 years ago,” Kiichi Fujiwara, a professor of international politics at Tokyo University, wrote bitingly on Twitter. He added that for Mr. Trump to use such language was “reckless and unwise, even as an act of deterrence.”  Tong Zhao, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, said that China still believed that a deal to defuse tensions could be reached, with North Korea agreeing to suspend its nuclear and missile tests in exchange for a halt to joint American and South Korean military exercises. China has raised that possibility repeatedly.  “It’s already a fact on the ground that North Korea has a credible nuclear deterrence,” he said. “The best we can do at the moment is to deter North Korea’s use of nuclear weapons and contain the growth of their nuclear and missile capabilities.”","2017-08-09 19:14:37.707306","Trump’s ‘Fire and Fury’ Threat Raises Alarm in Asia","{""United States International Relations"",""North Korea"",""Trump  Donald J"",""Nuclear Weapons"",""Embargoes and Sanctions"",China,Japan,""South Korea""}","{}","{""Steven Lee Myers"",""Choe Sang-Hun""}","2017-08-09 05:44:37"
"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/us/politics/trump-north-korea.html","BRIDGEWATER, N. J. — President Trump delivered his “fire and fury” threat to North Korea on Tuesday with arms folded, jaw set and eyes flitting on what appeared to be a single page of talking points set before him on the conference table at his New Jersey golf resort.  The piece of paper, as it turned out, was a fact sheet on the opioid crisis he had come to talk about, and his ominous warning to Pyongyang was entirely improvised, according to several people with direct knowledge of what unfolded. In discussions with advisers beforehand, he had not run the specific language by them, though he had talked over possible responses in a general way.  The inflammatory words quickly escalated the confrontation with North Korea to a new, alarming level and were followed shortly by a new threat from North Korea to obliterate an American air base on Guam. In the hours since, the president’s advisers have sought to calm the situation, with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson assuring Americans that they “should sleep at night” without worrying about an imminent war.  But the president’s ad-libbed threat reflected an evolving and still unsettled approach to one of the most dangerous hot spots in the world as Mr. Trump and his team debate diplomatic, economic and military options.  The president’s aides are divided on North Korea, as on other issues, with national security veterans like Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, on one side and Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, and his allies on the other.  While General McMaster and others consider North Korea a pre-eminent threat that requires a tough response, Mr. Bannon and others in the nationalist wing argue that it is really just a subset of the administration’s conflict with China and that Mr. Trump should not give more prominence to an unstable rogue operator like Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader.  Mr. Bannon’s allies in the alt-right media and activist groups have been waging a ferocious public attack against General McMaster, characterizing him as soft on issues like Iran, Israel and terrorism and promoting a hashtag #FireMcMaster. They are angry that General McMaster has pushed out several hard-liners associated with Mr. Bannon from the National Security Council staff. Mr. Trump came to General McMaster’s defense last week with a statement expressing confidence in him.  But in the North Korea debate, like a similar one over Afghanistan, Mr. Bannon has been arguing against what his side considers the excessively militant approach of the “war party” of General McMaster. While Mr. Bannon has his own channel to the president, he has been shut out of most formal discussions of North Korea by the national security team.  Neither camp advocated language like “fire and fury,” according to the people involved. Among those taken by surprise, they said, was John F. Kelly, the retired four-star Marine general who has just taken over as White House chief of staff and has been with the president at his golf club in Bedminster, N. J., for his working vacation.  The president had been told about a Washington Post story on North Korea’s progress in miniaturizing nuclear warheads so that they could fit on top of a ballistic missile, and was in a bellicose mood, according to a person who spoke with him before he made the statement. His team assumed that he would be asked about North Korea during a scheduled media appearance tied to his opioid meeting, but Mr. Trump had not mentioned his comment during a conference call beforehand that focused on North Korea.  “North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,” Mr. Trump told reporters in remarks aired on television and broadcast around the globe. “They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.”  But according to his advisers, Mr. Trump has used that phrase repeatedly in private discussions about North Korea. The president had been frustrated that the media had not given more attention to his success in winning a unanimous vote by the United Nations Security Council to impose more sanctions on North Korea.  “General Kelly and others on the N. S.C. team were well aware of the tone of the statement of the president prior to delivery. The words were his own,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday afternoon. “The tone and strength of the message were discussed beforehand. They were clear the president was going to respond to North Korea’s threats following the sanctions with a strong message in no uncertain terms.”  After making his public statement, Mr. Trump headed into an hourlong meeting on opioids, but his national security team huddled to figure out how to proceed. Mr. Tillerson became the obvious choice to calm the waters, which he did during a refueling stop in Guam, the same island threatened by North Korea.  “I think Americans should sleep well at night, have no concerns about this particular rhetoric of the last few days,” Mr. Tillerson told reporters. He added: “Nothing I have seen and nothing I know of would indicate that situation has dramatically changed in the last 24 hours.”  In effect, Mr. Trump and Mr. Tillerson became something of a good-cop-bad-cop combination — but that was more of an after-the-fact improvisation by the president’s team than an intentional strategy.  Still, other aides did not back off the sharp language.  “He’s saying don’t test America and don’t test Donald J. Trump,” Sebastian K. Gorka, a hard-line adviser, told Fox News on Wednesday. “We are not just the superpower. We were a superpower, we are now a hyper-power. Nobody in the world, especially not North Korea comes close to challenging our military capabilities.“","2017-08-09 19:14:48.284006","Trump’s Threat to North Korea Was Improvised","{""Trump  Donald J"",""North Korea"",""United States International Relations"",""United States Politics and Government"",""Nuclear Weapons""}","{https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/kim-jongun,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/us/politics/trump-mcmaster-national-security-conservatives.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/us/politics/white-house-michael-flynn-allies-national-security-council.html,https://www.nytimes.com/topic/destination/afghanistan,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/north-korea-now-making-missile-ready-nuclear-weapons-us-analysts-say/2017/08/08/e14b882a-7b6b-11e7-9d08-b79f191668ed_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_usnkorea-1212p%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.4cc38313d1fd,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/05/world/asia/north-korea-sanctions-united-nations.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/us/politics/north-korea-nuclear-threat-rex-tillerson.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=a-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news,http://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/donald-trump?inline=nyt-per,#whats-next}","{""Peter Baker"",""Glenn Thrush""}","2017-08-09 08:42:38"
